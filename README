Clone this repository to your home folder and copy the dotfiles in the root of
the repo to your home folders. The dotfiles in the configuration directory are
simple pointers to the actual configuration files that are located in the
corresponding sub directories of the configuration directory.

If you want to use the Autohotkey script, then the easies way is to create a
symlink from the file in the checkout to, for example, the startup folder in
the start menu. That way, all modifications are made to the actual file under
version control and not to a copy.
