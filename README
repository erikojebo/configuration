Clone this repository to your home folder and copy the dotfiles in the root of
the repo to your home folders. The dotfiles in the configuration directory are
simple pointers to the actual configuration files that are located in the
corresponding sub directories of the configuration directory.

If you want to use the Autohotkey script, then the easies way is to create a
symlink from the file in the checkout to, for example, the startup folder in
the start menu. That way, all modifications are made to the actual file under
version control and not to a copy.

When on a Windows machine with Cygwin installed, adding an environment
variable called HOME pointing to the cygwin /home/username/ directory avoids
having to checkout the configuration repository in your
c:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming folder, or whatever, in addition to checking
it out into your cygwin home directory. The reason for doing this is to make
emacs use the cygwin home directory as the user's home directory, so that the
same .emacs is used both in cygwin emacs and native windows emacs.
